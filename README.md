Current status of master: ![Travis CI master branch build status badge](https://travis-ci.org/timmattison/hotp-demo.svg?branch=master)

This repo contains the reference implementation of HOTP in Java from [RFC 4226](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226) and some JUnit test cases.

Eventually I might make a cleaner, non-static implementation of this and put it here.  Who knows?
